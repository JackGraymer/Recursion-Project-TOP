  <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fibonacci Sequence</a>, which sums each number with the one before it, is a great example of a problem that can be solved recursively.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Using iteration, write a function <code>fibs</code> which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of <code>8</code>, this method should return the array <code>[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]</code>.</li>
      <li>Now write another method <code>fibsRec</code> which solves the same problem recursively.  This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Build a function <code>mergeSort</code> that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.</li>
      <li>Tips:
        <ol>
          <li>Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).</li>
          <li>It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don’t quite understand what should be going on.</li>
